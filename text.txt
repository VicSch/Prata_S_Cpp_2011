At first glance, reading information from files seems to have little to do with cin and keyboard input, but there are two connections. First, many operating systems, including Unix, Linux, and the Windows Command Prompt mode, support redirection, which enables you to substitute a file for keyboard input. For example, suppose in Windows you have an executable program called gofish.exe and a text file called fishtale . In that case, you can give this command line in the command prompt mode.
